                            I am currently in my final year of studies, set to graduate in the spring of 2025.
                            I have been consistently intrigued by the ever-evolving landscape of our digital world, 
                            which led me to pursue computer engineering. In addition to my academic studies, 
                            I have gained valuable skills from various jobs, ranging from retail and restaurants to hospitality and everything in between. 
                            These experiences have given me adaptability and problem-solving abilities that I bring to my computer engineering career.
